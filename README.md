# 🏠 Property Valuation Data Mining Application

A comprehensive machine learning application for predicting property values using advanced data mining techniques. Developed as part of the Fundamentals of Data Mining (FDM) mini-project at SLIIT.

## 📋 Project Overview

This application leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately predict property prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and property characteristics. The system provides both regression predictions and price band classification.

**Dataset**: USA Real Estate Dataset (~2.2 million records)  
**Algorithms**: Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost  
**Frontend**: Streamlit web application  
**Backend**: Python with scikit-learn
